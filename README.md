## About the Project

Today's 2DO began as a backend school assignment focused on learning TypeScript, ESLint, API integration, and callback functions. Utilizing my designer background and frontend skillset. I enhanced it with a handcrafted design in Adobe Illustrator and added additional features to create a user friendly, functional task management experience.

The app features a nostalgic notebook aesthetic that puts users in a positive mindset while providing accesible organization tools and weather update to help a busy person choosing to bring an umbrella or sunglasses before venturing out in the elements.

## Features

- **Priority System**: Assign high, medium, or low priority to each task
- **Flexible Filtering**: View all tasks, pending tasks, or completed tasks
- **Quick Search**: Easily find specific tasks as your list grows
- **Priority Sorting**: Organize tasks by importance with one click
- **Weather Integration**: Get helpful weather advice and temperature (celcius) based on your location
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack

- **React**: Component-based UI architecture
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code for better reliability
- **Tailwind CSS**: Custom styling with utility-first approach

## User Experience Design

The app is designed around these key principles:

## Accessibility Features

Today's 2DO was built with accessibility in mind:

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark regions
- **Meaningful Alt Text**: Descriptive alternatives for all images
- **Status Announcements**: Screen reader notifications for task status changes
